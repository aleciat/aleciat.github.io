Post-Installation and Workflow
For every quiz, you'll be given a branch to checkout. You can always find it in the instructor notes. All of your work will be done in:

app/scripts/app.js
Serve / watch

gulp serve
This outputs an IP address you can use to locally test and another that can be used on devices connected to your network.

It's recommended to use Chrome, as non-vulcanized Polymer projects will load fastest on Chrome.

Build & Vulcanize

gulp
Build and optimize the current project, ready for deployment. This includes linting as well as vulcanization, image, script, stylesheet and HTML optimization and minification.

Troubleshooting

See this bug if you get the following error from Gyp:

"Error: self signed certificate in certificate chain"



****Essentially, a promise is a returned object to which you attach callbacks, instead of passing callbacks into a function.****

doSomething().then(function(result) {
  return doSomethingElse(result);
})
.then(function(newResult) {
  return doThirdThing(newResult);
})
.then(function(finalResult) {
  console.log('Got the final result: ' + finalResult);
})
.catch(failureCallback);

ES6=>
doSomething()
.then(result => doSomethingElse(result))
.then(newResult => doThirdThing(newResult))
.then(finalResult => {
  console.log(`Got the final result: ${finalResult}`);
})
.catch(failureCallback);
